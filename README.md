# Zip-File
# What are Zip files?
Zip files (.zip or .zipx) are single files, sometimes called "archives", that contain one or
more compressed files. Zip files make it easy to keep related files together and make
transporting, e-mailing, downloading and storing data and software faster and more
efficient. The Zip format is the most popular compression format used in the Windows
environment, and WinZip is the most popular compression utility.

#  Why do people use Zip files?
- Zip files compress data and therefore save time and space and make
downloading software and transferring e-mail attachments faster. Typical uses
for Zip files include:

  - Distributing files on the Internet: Only one download is required to obtain all related
files, and file transfer is quicker because the archived files are compressed.
  -  Sending a group of related files to an associate: When you distribute a collection of
files as a single Zip file, you benefit from the file grouping as well as compression.
  - Saving disk space: If you have large files that are important but seldom used, such as
large data files, simply compress the files into a Zip file and then unzip (or "extract")
them only when needed.
